IMU Configuration
=================

The IMU is used by the drone to get its attitude and its angular speed around its axis. It is composed of 3 accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes. Some chip also embbed 3 magnetometers. This device needs to be calibrated, and the drone needs to know how it is fixed to its frame.

See http://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/ImuCalibration for more details.

The accelerometers and gyro calibration is relative to the physical device you have. The magneto calibration is relative to the physival device AND the environment, i.e. the drone itself (battery, GPS...).

Accelerometer configuration

**Add the IMU module**

In your airframe file in the `firmware` section, add the `imu` module corresponding to your hardware (Replace `apogee` in the example below.) :

    .. code-block:: xml
    
      <firmware name="fixedwing">
        ...
        <module name="imu" type="apogee">
        ...
      </firmware>
